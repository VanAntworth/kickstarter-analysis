# Kickstarter Analysis

Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

### Purpose
This excel project was created to assist Louise with her project campaign. Data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects 
was conductedto uncover hidden trends. The tabular data provided was used to then further add tablar data to show trends and correlate given data to best help Louise set up a succesful campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

Took time to review and understand data presented. Determining best data to compare. Understanding what data was crucial to best show trends.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


To best show Louise a breakdown of correlations between Launch Date and successful Theater campaigns a pivot table was created to compare outcomes by month and a line chart was made to best visualize this data.

Overall percent successful decreases as the goal amount increases.

There is an increase between 35-45 thousand but the number of projects in that range are insignificant to total projects.Showing more data could provide more insight.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- Two conclusions that can be drawn about the Outcomes based on Launch Date 

The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all 
had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend 
lines of the chart. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The lower the Goal amount the higher rate of success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
